# **Applied Machine Learning - Welcome**

## Introduction
This course provides an overview of key algorithms and concepts in machine learning, with a focus on applications. Introduces supervised and unsupervised learning, including logistic regression, support vector machines, neural networks, Gaussian mixture models, as well as other methods for classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. Covers foundational concepts such as overfitting, regularization, maximum likelihood estimation, generative models, latent variables, and non-parametric methods. Applications include data analysis on images, text, time series, and other types of data using modern software tools such as numpy, scikit-learn, and pytorch.

<!-- ## What You Will Learn
Key elements of this course include:

* The most important algorithms in machine learning
* Fundamental concepts needed to reason about learning algorithms
* Techniques for implementing and deploying ML in practice

This course provides both a theoretical and a practical foundation in machine learning. It covers a broad range of algorithms, and defines each algorithm using both mathematics and Python code. -->

## Prerequisites

This masters-level course requires a background in mathematics and programming at the level of introductory college courses. Experience in Python is recommended, but not required. A certain degree of ease with mathematics will be helpful.

* Programming experience (ideally Python; Cornell CS 1110 or equivalent)
* Linear algebra. (Cornell MATH 2210, MATH 4310 or equivalent)
* Statistics and probability. (Cornell STSCI 2100 or equivalent)
